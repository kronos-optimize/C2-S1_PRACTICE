    <p>During my stay in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siem_Reap">Siem Reap</a> for the past two months, I have done many interesting activities. First, I went to the famous
        temple, Angkor Wat, and took many pictures. Then, I drove through the Angkor Thom area while riding a tuk tuk. I also visited 
        Neak Porn temple, and it was really beautiful during the rainy season.
    </p>
    <p>I then stayed home for a few more weeks until it was Pchum Ben holiday. During Pchum Ben, I went to the pagoda with my friends, and I visited Angkor Wat again that day.
        Then, the next day, I went to the pagoda with my mother. 
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>My stay in Siem Reap was very fruitful because I got to spend more time with my friends and family. I also travelled a lot more than I have before.
        Hopefully, next time I go back to Siem Reap would be as fun as this trip. Lastly, here are some more photos I posted on my socials about my
        trip. You can click on this <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/zuck/">Facebook link</a>.
